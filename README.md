Alok's Lotto Generator
==============

Alok's Lotto Generator is an application which generates Canada Lotto Tickets based on an algorithm that I wrote. This algorithm tries to find trends of winning draw using the approach of "hot numbers", sums of draw numbers, sum of draw digits and number of odd and even numbers in a draw.

One cool feature of the algorithm is that it does screen scrapping of the Lotto Canada's web page to get the latest result and then use them in calculation. 


Requires:

python 2.6 or higher (can run with python 2.7 but not tested)
pyQt4 (latest version avaialble)
beautiful soup for python (latest version avaiable)
